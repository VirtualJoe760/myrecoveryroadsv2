# My Recovery Roads v2
<hr>

## So happy to have this as a fully functional website now.

Its been a good wonderful journey since I created the landing page myrecoveryroads.com to help people struggling with addiction seek treatment. I'm happy to have launched V2 which has a blog element to the sight, as well as a provider signup to create partnerships with health care providers.

This website uses 11ty, netlify forms, and mailchimp to automate a system of patient intake with Zero data storage. 

I will be looking forward to seeing this project progress, and am already thinking of ways to expand on it with a V3.
