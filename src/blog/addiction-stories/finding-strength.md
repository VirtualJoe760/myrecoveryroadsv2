# Finding Strength: Overcoming Addiction and Trauma

I am a recovering alcoholic and addict. Growing up in a household where mental illness and emotional management were not acknowledged was challenging. My journey to recovery began with a traumatic experience at 18, which led to PTSD. Despite my struggles with PTSD, alcoholism, and mental health issues, I managed to graduate from university.

My path to healing included a year of therapy, during which I faced being ostracized from my family, unrelated to my alcoholism. I resorted to heavy drinking to cope with this loss. My life spiraled further out of control when I stopped therapy. At 25, I entered a rehabilitation center and learned about my alcoholism and various mental health issues, including PTSD, Bipolar Disorder, Anxiety, Major Depressive Disorder, and later, ADHD.

Despite making progress, I struggled with boundaries and emotional management, leading to a relapse on fentanyl and significant financial loss. I resumed recovery and landed a promising job in graphic design, but then found myself in an abusive relationship. This relationship introduced me to meth as an alternative to fentanyl, leading to homelessness after my attempts to secure sober living were unsuccessful.

The following year and a half were filled with turmoil, including another abusive relationship that threatened my safety. Eventually, I made it back to rehab, escaping homelessness and cutting ties with my abuser.

Since achieving sobriety, I have experienced spiritual growth, a heightened awareness of my mental health, and the rebuilding of relationships with my family. My transformation involved therapy, education, medication, mentorship, and a commitment to spiritual surrender. I've learned that it's never too late to change, and the strength within is always greater than the challenges we face.
